# Quick Test



The XV Lidar Controller is designed to very rapidly let you know you have a fully functional XV Lidar.

Start by getting the controller connected.

* Plug the 2 pin motor connector and the 4 pin serial connector to the XV Lidar Controller.

* Plug a USB cable from the XV Lidar Controller to any USB power source.


Once connected the XV Lidar should begin spinning and the Teensy's LED will begin blinking.  The blinking LED indicates the controller is reciving valid data from the lidar.  That's it.  Now you know the Lidar and controller are working.



If the lidar does not spin or stops spinning after a few seconds see the [troubleshooting section](/troubleshooting.md) for more information.

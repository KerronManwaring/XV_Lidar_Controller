# Visualizing the Lidar Data

This again is just one method of visualizing the data.  It is not a requirement to install any of these tools for your project.

In this example we're going to use a python script that was written by profmason.[^1] Python is cross platform and allows this test to be run from Linux, Mac and Windows.

### Software Requirements

* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/)

* [pyserial - ](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyserial)use pypy to install

* [VPython](http://vpython.org/)


1. Download the [lidar](http://www.getsurreal.com/wp-content/uploads/lidar.zip) script
2. Edit the lidar script and set com\_port to point your Teensy
3. Connect up to controller board
4. Launch the python script
5. The program starts out showing the data in a horizontal plane which doesnâ€™t look like much. Click into the image and drag the pointer to adjust the point of view.
6. Proceed to move objects in out out of the path of the lidar for enjoyment.
